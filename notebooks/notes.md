# Notes
## Setup

- tether
- setup OSC conn (in / out)
- open TouchOSC app / show examples
- open static page in tab
- quicktime iphone feedback
- uncollapse model viewer 

## Mention
- I have the pleasure to share the fun in bulding Clerk at Nextjournal
- present somewhat exotic example of a Clerk notebook 
- toolset for turning a clojure namespace into a live web application
- explore a simple model with frequencies and amplitudes by means of an interactive spirograph
- which is a "closed" curve function of time
- you should see the feedback of my phone screen here, changing parameters
- for the harmonic analysis freaks among you there's a wave mode of course 
- an explanation of the moving parts and the OSC protocol wiring
- start and connect a Java OSC server (local first / but also static publishing)
- it's not disruptive of your repl flow / save models you produce with fingers
