;; # ê©œ An OSC _fourieristic_ Spirograph
;; _This short notebook shows how to use an [OSC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control)
;; driven controller to interact with vector graphic animations in Clerk. OSC is generally used for networking live multimedia
;; devices and sound synthesizers, but as [noted a while ago by Joe Armstrong](https://joearms.github.io/published/2016-01-28-A-Badass-Way-To-Connect-Programs-Together.html) its
;; simplicity makes it an interesting choice for exchanging data across machines in a broader range of applications._

^{::clerk/visibility :hide}
(ImageIO/read (io/resource "spirograph.png"))

;; the linear faders in the above UX will control the phasors amplitudes while radial ones change their frequencies.
;;
;; OSC messages are composed of an _address_ and sequential _arguments_. We configured our interface to emit message
;; arguments of the form `[value & path]` where the first entry is an integer in the range `0` to `100` while the tail is a valid path in
;; the model. In this application we're ignoring the message address.
;;
;; In order to receive OSC messages, we instantiate an OSC Server. We're overlaying an extra broadcast layer on top of the simple echo server
;; provided by the [JavaOSC library](https://github.com/hoijui/JavaOSC) this will allow to debug incoming messages in the terminal.
;;
;; Received events are tapped into the JVM for them to be handled with clojure functions, this piece shows Java interop at its best!
